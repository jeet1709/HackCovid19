Before executing num_plate_detect.py file we need to download "lapi.weights" file from the drive link https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oZsKdva-IUTVFBFegM8h3HlC_w0SqfBY (since lapi.weights file is really large we wee not able to upload it on Github)

To execute num_plate_detect.py we need to pass argument in terminal in such manner:
if detection 
1)python num_plate_detect.py --image image_name.jpg
2)python num_plate_detect.py --video video_name.mp4
